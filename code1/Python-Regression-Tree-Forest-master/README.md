Python-Regression-Tree-Forest
=============================

Python implementation of regression trees and random forests. See "Classification and Regression Trees" by Breiman et al. (1984).

The regression_tree_cart.py module contains the functions to grow and use a regression tree given some training data.

football_parserf.py is an example implementation of regression_tree_cart.py that predicts an NFL player's fantasy points given their statistics from the previous year. The data is stored in football.csv. 

The random_forest.py module contains the functions to grow a random forest and use it for prediction.
